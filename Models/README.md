###Streetlight###
The model shown here is covered in a project writeup I included with my resume submission. It was a birthday gift I made for my girlfriend, a light-activated nightlight with the theme of her favorite band (Streetlight Manifesto). It was also my first foray into 3D modelling/3D printing.

Full disclosure: The model was made in a modeling program called Tinkercad by Autodesk (because it was online and free). I'm certain I can quickly learn modeling programs you may require, but this is an example of some work I have made.

The embedded logos were downloaded, cleaned up in GIMP and imported into Tinkercad. The logos are the only artwork I did not produce in the model.

The model features a fitted battery tray and wiring conduits as well as a battery clip that is pretty satisfying to close (nothing like a nice **\*click\***).

###Landmine Icon###
I used to make mods back in the day for a game called Blockland. I learned to proficiently use GIMP and really enjoy photo editing. This is one small example of my photo editing skills.
