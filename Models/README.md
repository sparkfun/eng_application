* **/Annulus Revised.skp** - 3D model of an annulus with the location of thermistors used for my  experimental study of "Thermal Convection Driven by Centrifugal Buoyancy in a Rapidly Rotating Annulus." This model created around 2010 in SketchUp as part of my old undergraduate research project with the CU Boulder's Applied Math department and NSF's Mentoring through Critical Transition Points. The device was originally constructed by John Hart and Scott Kittelman to try and model Busse's theory with the convective columns of a Jovian planet.
