Models Sample
==============

Instructions
------------

Please include a sample model in this folder. 

A model from one of your personal projects is preferred, though anything that demonstrates your ability with one of the following types of programs is acceptable:

* SolidWorks
* FreeCAD
* Sketchup
* Blender
* Fritzing
* Illustrator
* Inkscape

Additional points
------------------

* The model does not need to be overly complex, if creating one from scratch.
* This must be your original work. Any partial contributions from others should be attributed. 

*Attribution notes

Though the entity "Majora's Mask" is intellectual property of Nintendo, the model provided is entirely my original work, as in I arbitrarily decided the exact dimensions and specifications of all aspects of the model. This was done purely on the intention of improving my modelling abilities. No profit was made or is intended to be made from this model.
