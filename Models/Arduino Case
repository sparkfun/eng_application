The following link will take you to a dropbox containing a 3D Arduino case design as an .stl file.  The model was created in SketchUp 
and features two parts, a top and bottom, which are designed to snap together and hold in place.  Unfortunatly, I have so far been 
unable to test my design.  I have attempted to 3D print it several times, but unfortunatly the printer I use constantly malfunctions.
If I had been able to print the design, I am sure that I would find areas that need slight tweeking.
