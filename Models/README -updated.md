Models Sample
==============
The provided model is from a project I did for my father and sister's organic farm.  They were exploring the idea of building an air conditioner based walk-in cooler at the farm to store produce after picking and before taking to the markets.

The model is of the final design, with components in the outliner hideable to see the interior, and several options for shelf layouts and their capacities in the field next to the cooler.

The sink, faucet and doors were specified by the customer, and I used a model for the air conditioner similar to one we were thinking about using. All were found in the Ggogle SketchUp 3D Warehouse.
