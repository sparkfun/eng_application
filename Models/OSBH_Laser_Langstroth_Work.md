For my model submission, please navigate to the open source beehives repository at:
https://github.com/opensourcebeehives/Community_Projects/tree/master/Langstroth_1.0.0

###To Edit/Alter Model:
I used Autodesk Inventor to build this Langstroth hive in February of last year.
If I recall, it's kind of a pain to convert from the parts and assemblies to other 
CAD types, but if you navigate to the /documentation/ directory you will find some 
pretty pictures that demonstrate some key angles and hive layouts for routing.

###Description of the Work:
For this model, my primary goal was to provide a rework of one of the oldest open source
pieces of hardware.  The Langstroth beehive is one of the core hives that has existed for
centuries in its current configuration.  It provides a modular approach to beehives which
reduces perturbation of the bees themselves and waste of honey and comb due by utilizing
"bee-space".  My update to this design takes the hive from a project requiring specialized
woodworking tools and replaces it with a more Maker-friendly router or mill.  The hive linked
was designed specifically to be routed with minimal waste from a 3/4" sheet of plywood.
