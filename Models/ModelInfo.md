# Models

## Oliver St Model

When the Baltimore Node hackerspace moved to a location on Oliver St., I 
created this model of the new space in SketchUp so we could see how our 
tables and other furnishings would fit in the new space.  The person and 
the Tardis were both models that I imported from the 3D warehouse.  Unfortunately, I do not remember the source of these models.

## Flag 

### Background
Several universities in the state of Mississippi have taken down the state 
flag after the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2001, a new 
flag that did not contain the Confederate emblem were proposed.  However,
it was not adopted by the state.  

### Flag Proposal
The flag in this directory was a flag that I created in Inkscape this year 
when some friends were re-imagining the flag for the state of Mississippi. 
I used Inkscape to make the 20 stars, representing Mississippi as the 20th
state point out from the center of the circle.
