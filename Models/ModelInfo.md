## 3D Modeling
Most of my previous 3D design work has been done in SolidWorks for assemblies and enclosures, and in Altium for board designs
and discrete components. The vast majority of my work was done under NDA though, so I no longer have access to it.

I have included a [picture](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lrd2y0k3x2dmajo/20151202_165809.jpg?dl=0)  of my SolidWorks certificate and also the object I created my 3D model from; its just a simple Chromecast power adaptor.

I created the [model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/poynkz8k7qg67f1/DanNichol-USBPlug.FCStd?dl=0) in freeCAD which I have never used before so that was a good learning experience. It seems capable but not nearly as fluid, stable, and polished as SolidWorks is.
