Model notes
==============

Details
-------

* This assembly was made in Solidworks 2016.
* It is a mechanical mockup for a project that sends a text message when an interrupt is tripped
* The components other than the case are simple mockups

The Components
--------------
* 1CR18650 is a standard lipo battery
* 32u4 breakout is a custom board for this project
* Adafruit FONA 3G breakout is the gsm radio being used
* Standoffs are standard pcb spacers
* Bolts are standard m3s
* The two case halves are designed to be 3d printed

Reference
---------
* 1CR18650 was made from measurements of a sample on hand
* Adafruit FONA 3G breakout was made from pictures from the Adafruit website
* 32u4 breakout is designed to be the same size as the radio breakout
* Standoffs were made from measurements
* The two case halves were designed from scratch

TODO
----
* Improve 3d printablity
* Examine board supports
* Design a robust mounting solution
* Design a better waterproofing plan than "smear hot glue on all the joints and holes"
