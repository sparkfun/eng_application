Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?
Negotiable.

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?
My ideal weekly schedule would be that every week I learn something new and get to really grow and stretch my 
mind and be surrounded by people who are eager and enthusiastic and value sharing knowledge and learning themselves. 
My ideal weekly schedule would also entail having time to play around with standard engineering tools and also 
coming home with knowledge that would be helpful for me as an inventor.

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)
Negotiable.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?
Don't have a dog, but don't mind (as long as it is a well-trained, behaved dog).

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 
Good question, I'm not sure (never thought about it, really). Probably the opposite of me would be someone who wears very creative clothing and has a very creative hairstyle with a face piercing. This alter ego would most likely have a lot of different skills and has accomplished different things that a lot of people wouldn't understand how they were able to get in the position that would grant them these opportunities (something like: neurosurgeon by day, music producer by night). They probably wouldn't let the way they look dictate where they want to go next.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 
I really want to be able to work on a breadth of different hardware projects, to be honest.
