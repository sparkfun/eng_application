Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

**As I mentioned in my application, my husband and I are currently in the process of moving from the Washington DC area to Colorado. The earliest I can start is the end of January.** 

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

**Since this is a part time job, I would prefer when I am at work for it to be a full day. It wouldn't matter to me whether that meant either coming in every other day or the first half of the week. I just feel I would be more productive with that kind of schedule.**

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

**Range = ($25,000/year , $35,000/year)** 

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

**Yes, absolutely! I have four dogs at home all ranging from 8 lbs to 80 lbs. I imagine at some point I would bring one of them with me to work once in a while.**

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

**I'm going to have to say Fox Moulder from the X-Files, because as much as I am logical I do secretly open myself up to the idea of extreme possibilities. :alien: "I want to believe." Also, I just think that would be the coolest job ever, but of course second to a job at SparkFun Electronics. :wink:**

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

**Amongst the various tasks listed for this position, the ones that excite me the most are creating demo projects and writing code/tutorials. I could really see myself enjoying that.**
