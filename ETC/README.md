Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

Monday 10-2

Otherwise, here is a projected schedule based on my current class schedule:
Monday: 8-2

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

I enjoy and have no problems with dogs. If I get a dog during my employment at Sparkfun, I would certainly consider bringing it along.

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

Wallflower

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

I'm a sucker for organized light and sound, especially music visualization. Something like SoundPuddle is absolutely fascinating to me, so anything pertaining to making responsive light and sound (or basically anything that's tantalizing) is of interest to me, but of course anything that broadens my knowledge of electronics or possibilities of projects is of interest as well.
