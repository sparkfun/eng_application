Warm Fuzzies
=============


##When can you start?

*I currently work for another company so I would have to give notice that I am quitting. I would probebly be availible to work about two weeks from whenever the offer is on the table*

##What is your ideal weekly schedule?

*My ideal weekly schedule would be a 4 day work week with each day as long as it needs to be to get the job done. The other three days of the week I would spend seeing friends, playing my bass or persuing other various hobbies.*

##What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

*I am early in my career and I believe that the minimum I would be comfortable accepting would be $15/hour the highest would be about $25/hour since I am new to the industry. I would prefer to have wage based on completion of products and tasks though because I believe fixed wage contracts encourage inefficient employees. Variable wage motivates them to complete tasks and succeed.*   

##SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

*I love dogs, I do not currently own a dog but if I did I would be completely comfortable bringing them to hang out with the good people at sparkfun.*
 
##Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

*I find this question surprizingly difficult to answer because I have never really placed myself in a specific group. I can play sports with the athletes and game with the gamers. I see myself as an inventor but I draw alot from the energy and diversity of people around me.*

##What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

*The area I would most enjoy focusing on is product design and project management, Specific areas that I could bring my skills to are creation of quality Solidworks models and electromechanicle design including sensors and motors.*
