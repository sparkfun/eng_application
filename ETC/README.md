Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

I can start as soon as possible, assuming that I am capable of working remotely.

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

Ideally, during a college semester while classes are in session, I would like to do most of my work on weekends, or in the evening, as that is when I would have the most available time. However, during breaks I would find it ideal to work at a regular time in the morning or at noon for an even period time for each weekday.

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

The miniumum I would be comfortable accepting would be $10 an hour, while I don't think that I think I am worth is $17 an hour (Based on the range of compensation of positions I have applied for)

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

As discussed in an email during this application, I would likely work remotely. However, I am comfortable around dogs. I also do not have a dog.

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

I'd say that my cultural alter ego would be a Muse. I find that I get really passionate about things, and I enjoy spreading that passion to other people. For instance, when I was learning how to use Blender, I found that I wanted to help other people learn it as well, so I spoke to my friends about it, and many of them found that they could utilize it for their own projects; for instance, one of them thought making 3-D models could help them better learn how to draw architectural scenes, while another found that the cloth physics engine would be helpful to her for when she designs clothing. One of the reasons that I would like to have this position is for that reason: So that I could help people find a passion in electrical projects.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

I would like to gather experience working with drivers for various sensors, either through writing tutorials for people who want to use some sensor or sensor breakout, or through writing those drivers based on datasheets. I would like to gain this experience because I would like to pursue studies involved with embedded systems in college, and I think that working with sensor drivers would contribute well to this goal.
