Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

**1. When can you start?**

As soon as I am allowed to move to engineering and when a technical support representative is able to replace my position in the department. 

**2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?**

Monday-Friday (~9:30am to ~6pm). On certain days when I teach dance, I leave early. Usually, it is on Wednesdays at 3:00pm-3:30pm during the Fall, Winter, and Spring. If I am subbing a class or helping out (which is rare), I might be out for a long lunch or leave slightly early. If necessary, I try to catch up on the workload and make up hours by working from home.

**3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)**

My current salary as a technical support representative (~$42,000 yearly) to about ~$50,000 yearly.

**4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?**

Of course I love dogs! I love seeing puppies and dogs. I do not currently have a dog because my living situation does not allow dogs. 

**5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?**

I am a bboy (dancer) by heart so you can say that I am an artist.

**6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team?**

While our tutorials and documentation has been great, I personally feel like it does not cover all aspects of a product when they are being used in the field. Whenever issues came up, I noticed that we did not have a smooth method of relaying solutions between customers and each technical support representative. The issues tab in Sparkle is great but it is not useful in sharing public information to the customer. I decided try create "tech support tips/troubleshooting/common issues" in the comments section for certain products and unify documentation on the public facing side. The hope was for customers to search for this information and save time whenever a technical support representative handled the same case. Maybe we can start having sections in tutorials for common problems that may arise or start utilizing the tech tips section.

Communication has improved with the Go Live Dashboard but it feels like the support department is left in the dark with certain releases. There is no training so the support representatives often are left frantically searching and trying to find a solution with a case. I would also like to continue working with tech support and all the other departments to relay information with our products to the best of my ability. This can include new products coming down the pipeline, documentation, resources, project tutorials, 3D models, Fritzing diagrams, problem products, tech support feedback, and product reviews.

There are also some old problem products that could have better documentation (fingerprint scanner, Ryan Owen's documentation for the old serial enabled LCD, old out-of-date comparison guides, etc). When I became frustrated with the same fingerprint scanner questions, I took it upon myself to finally write a hookup guide once Toni provided the guidelines and the ability to review a few tutorials. It would be great to try and maintain some of these web pages while still rolling out new content.
