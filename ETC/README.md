Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

**1. When can you start?**

  I can start about a week after I have an offer.  I will need to wrap up 
  things like organizing my dust bunny collection by size and
  color.

**2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?**

  Ideally, I would work Tuesday through Fridays in either the mornings or 
  afternoons.  I think that having a consistent schedule makes it
  easier for the team.  I would pick either the morning or afternoon based on 
  the hours that the people who need me like to keep.  I could also work on 
  Monday mornings if needed, but I am guessing that a lot of engineers prefer 
  to work a little later in the day.
  
**3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)**

  I think that this position should be paying about $15/hr based on the fact 
  that [Student Assistant
  IIIs](http://www.colorado.edu/studentemployment/descriptions-pay-codes) at CU
  make about $11/hr to $13/hr.  I add an extra $2/hr for
  commute.  If I was working a full time job that involved the type of math 
  that would bore others to tears, I would be worth $85,000 a
  year. 

**4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?**

  I don't have a dog, but I am generally comfortable working around dogs.  I 
  once had a boss that would bring his dog into the office after the dog had 
  her spa day, and the dog smelled so nice.  I would not be comfortable working
  around dogs if the office had a major
  flea problem or if the carpet that smelled like pee like in this

**5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?**

  My cultural alter-ego is an incompetent dancer.  I have been taking 
  introductory ballet classes for about a year.  If we measured my
  linear elasticity using 
  [Young's modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus), I 
  think that I started at the elacticity of copper and moved down to the 
  type of brass that is slightly more elastic.I have also been an aerial dance 
  diletante for about ten years. Though this is irrelevant to most life skills,
  it did allow me to lift 20 pound marine batteries by a single hand at one 
  of my old jobs.

**6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team?** 
  
  I am interested in creating demo projects, designing 3D models, and writing 
  basic code examples.
