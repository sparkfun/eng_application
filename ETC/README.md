Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

December 17th, onward.

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

I am hoping for the possibility of working on the weekends some, but it's my understanding that Sparkfun operates on normal business hours. Otherwise ideal is anything that fits with my next semester's class schedule and doesn't force me to wake up before the sun rises. As it stands, my earliest days end by 3:00pm, and my latest day ends at 6:00pm (Tuesday).

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

$10-$15 per hour

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

I enjoy and have no problems with dogs. If I get a dog during my employment at Sparkfun, I would certainly consider bringing it along.

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

Wallflower

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

I'm a sucker for organized light and sound, especially music visualization. Something like SoundPuddle is absolutely fascinating to me, so anything pertaining to making responsive light and sound (or basically anything that's tantalizing) is of interest to me, but of course anything that broadens my knowledge of electronics or possibilities of projects is of interest.
