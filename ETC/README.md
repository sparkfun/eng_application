Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

I could start as early as the first few weeks of January.

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

As a 20-hr per week job, I'd ideally like to work a couple full days and a half day.  In a perfect world that would be a half day on Wednesday, and full days on Thursday and Friday.  However, I'm amenable to any schedule that works best for the team.  It would be nice to have one weekday I could take off if it was 20 hours per week.  As full time, it would be nice to substitute working a weekend day for a weekday, but again--whatever works best for the team is fine with me.

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

For the 20-hr per week job, I could accept 35k, but I think I could add enough value to the company to be worth 50k.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

I love dogs, if I had one again, I would bring it to work (as I have before).

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 

Nate Dogg

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

Anything that's needed most would be fun, designing circuit boards, making tutorials, making models--just about anything.
