Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?
* I can - and want - to start as soon as possible.

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?
* My  *ideal* schedule would be 3 tens, on M-T-W. If the 20 hours/week is firm, then either two tens, on M-T or 6-7-6 or similar on M-T-W.

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)
* 22 to 35/hr

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?
* I grew up with and love dogs. I don't currently have one, but if I did I would likely bring him/her into work.

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?
* Gene Kranz, a steely eyed missile man. "Let's work the problem people. Let's not make things worse by guessing." Is one of my favorite quotes of all time. Breaking down a problem into parts and calmly working them individually is the key to any large project.

* Mark Watney would also be a good choice, for similar reasons, but with the added bonus of being hilarious.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team?
* My two favorite things are aviation and robotics. Projects related to those two subjects would be awesome. Whatever projects I work on, I would like to play to my strengths of system design and firmware development. As it happens, I just read the latest Enginursday, and I love the format. I'd like to write articles on Kalman filters, PID controllers, and the Robot Operating System, just to name a few.
