4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?
   I love dogs. I have an 11-year-old Bichon Frise who would probably love the SparkFun office.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 
   The three topics that I find the most compelling are art, fashion, and music. I would be thrilled to create projects, documentation and tutorials for people looking use SparkFun products in those areas.  I have strong design skills, and I could see myself contributing diagrams, illustrations, or infographics for a variety of topics as needed.
