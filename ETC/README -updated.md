Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

I can start this week starting December 9, 2015.  I'm currently en route back home from an extended Thanksgiving/farm work trip, and will be back by Tuesday the 8th.

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

My schedule is currently flexible as far as which days of the week are available to work with you.  Also, I can easily meet the 20 hours per week in the job description.  And hopefully, shoud things go well, am open to adding more hours.  The only caveat is that my commute will be about an hour, not insurmountible, but it would help to have the hours in as close to full work days as possible.

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

The least I would feel comfortable accepting is $17/hr but given the opportunity I'm sure I can easily provide the value of over $25/hr.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

I love dogs. I grew up with dogs, and would be very happy to share my workspace with them. I don't currently have one, but I also have a feeling that the time for that to chang is drawing near.

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?

I addition to enoying pushing electrons around, I love woodworking and restoring woodworking tools.  The simplicity and effectivity of these ancient machines is an inspiration to the engineer in me.  I'm also developing a moderately serious watercolor habit.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team?

SparkFun already produces a lovely variety of development and prototyping tools, but I believe there is a large opportunity for expansion in the (almost) established market around home automation.  With the variety of internet enabled home automation hubs serving the same role that arduino has done for the DIY robotics community, SparkFun can help proliferate the other end of the connection.  Lighting, HVAC, automatic plant and pet care, temperature controlled ovens, or frypans, the options possible with home automation go much further than the major manufacturers are currently taking it.
