Hello!

1. I am looking for a position for the Summer of 2016, starting in June. Ideally it would be an internship position.
2. I would prefer to work full time!
3. \$15/hr to \$27/hr
4. I would love to work around dogs! Unfortunately I don't have a dog :(
5. I may not seem like it at first, but I'm a total car guy. I love driving trucks and fixing classic cars. Restoring them is a hobby of mine.
6. While I do have a varied background in software/digital applications, I'd actually like to challenge myself more and hone my skills in analog circuit design. I would still like to work on embedded systems to some degree, maybe mix in some IoT, cloud computing and mobile applications as well. More recently I have become interested in chip-level design (ASICs, VLSI). I would love to learn how to design PCBs and see them go from idea to product. I am always willing to learn!
