=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?

01.04.2016


2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?

I'll taking a couple of courses next semester and they are in the afternoon. A morning schedule during the weekdays should work. 

Tentative schedule: 
Monday: 9:00 - 2:00
Tuesday: 9:00 - 2:00
Thursday: 9:00 - 2:00
Friday: 9:00 - 2:00


3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)

Salary range from $15/h to $30/h


4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

I like dogs and have no problem with them around. I fell comfortable with them but I do not have one at this moment because of my schedule.  


5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?

Mexican soccer player Rafael Marquez. I identify myself with him for three main reasons. The first one is that he plays the same position (defense) that I used to play when I was a kid, and he excels at it. The second reason is because of his passion for what he does and his courage to follow his dreams. I am also very passionate, not about soccer but about designing and innovating electronic devices, and like to give my best in order to achieve my dreams. The third reason is because of his altruistic work to help kids to have a decent education and the tools to achieve their dreams. I also think that education and opportunity are the best tools a person can have to succeed, and I like to get involved and help people as much as I can.
 

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 

I love digital and hardware design. It would be great to get involved in the development of new products or maintenance of existing products. I also enjoy writing code - especially low level and designing circuits. These three areas are my preferred ones:

-Digital/Hardware Design
-Writing code libraries for products
-Designing circuits diagrams for product

I'd also like to get involved in other duties to get familiar with the products, the development and documentation processes and to expand my knowledge.
