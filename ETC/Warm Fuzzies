Warm Fuzzies
=============

Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:

1. When can you start?  

* Realistically, I can start any day. I could start Yesterday, but that would mean I missed my first day on the job and that doesn't leave a great first impression.  

2. What is your ideal weekly schedule?
* I'm quite flexible, I can work whenever I am needed. I would say that Tuesday and Wednesday are my  least busy days, I get progressively busier as we get closer to Sunday and Monday which are the worst days for me.  

*  As for hours, it would be amazing to avoid rush hour traffic at either end of the day; that might be too greedy though.  

3. What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)
* In the past I have worked for upwards of $23/hr, but I will admit that was full-time and I was responsible for a good deal. I would think that anything in the $13-25 is reasonable for a part-time, assistant type position.

4. SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?

* I have two Dogs(and a 14lb Cat who thinks he is a Dog); an 11 year old ChocoLab, and a 2.5 year old shepherd mix. I am absolutely comfortable being/working around dogs. The older one I could bring to work no problem, the (still very much a)puppy would have issues with that level of stimulation I think. She is fine sitting in my office with me at home for hours but that is with minimal distractions.

5. Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)? 
* I had a hard time finding a single person to be my alter-ego; My best fit would be a mix of Mr.Spock(Leonard Nimoy - StarTrek) and Galen Tyrol "The Chief" (Aaron Douglas - Battestar Galactica).

* This question is amazing, I had to sit and mull it over for a good while until I really found an answer that I felt covered everything. I feel that I am a charismatic leader rather than a dictator, I am not a "My way or the highway" kind of person. I am calm, passionate, analytical, and ultra rational that will use humor to engage people and build trust. I open with humor, but follow through along a logical rational path.

6. What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team? 
* I would say that I am most comfortable with the debug/troubleshooting aspect of electrical engineering, but, I am most interested in the design side of things, it has been the most engaging. I believe I have the skillset to support any role that is asked of me, If I am lacking in a certain skill, I am willing to learn.
