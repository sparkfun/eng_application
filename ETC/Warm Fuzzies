+Let us get to know you a bit better. Please answer the following:
+
+When can you start?
+
+Immediately!  Working at Sparkfun is my dream job, and I would love to start as soon as possible.
+
+What is your ideal weekly schedule?
+
+I am available all day, every day, and I dont usually sleep past 7 - even if I wanted to, my dog wouldn't let me!
+
+What is your desired compensation range? Range = (least you are comfortable accepting, max you think you are worth)
+
+$13.00 - $20.00/hr
+
+SparkFun is a dog-friendly, dog-filled environment. Are you comfortable working around dogs? If you have a dog, would you see yourself bringing your dog to work?
+
+I absolutely love dogs!  In fact, I have been fostering and rescuing dogs for as long as I can remember.  I am the proud owner of a beautiful Chesapeake Bay retriever mix and I try and take him everywhere I go, so I would definitely bring him in to work!
+
+Who is your cultural alter-ego (athlete, artist, author, actor, alien, etc.)?
+
+Besides hacking I'm passionate about cooking, athletics, and emerency medicine - I'm hoping to get my EMT certification in the near future!
+
+What topics would you like to focus on while working with the engineering team?
+
+I would love to focus on educational boards and tutorials.  I think that one of the greatest things about Sparkfun is that you make seemingly complicated electronics more accessible and understandable and in turn open up a new world of creativity for people, and I think we have a sort of obligation to continue to teach and make these tools even more accessible to young students.  I would also love to start working with robotics (but, of course).
