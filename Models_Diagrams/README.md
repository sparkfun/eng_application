Modeling Samples
================

Included here are several Model Samples. They include a Fritzing layout, along with a couple of 3D builds I've recently completed. (Recently = within the last year.) 

The Fritzing Diagram is for the Singing Nutcracker build that currently sits at my desk. It is the same build for which I've submitted my code sample. Just trying to tie things together here.

The 3D models are from two separate builds. The first will be familiar to Funions, and that's the [Safe Cracking Robot](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/building-a-safe-cracking-robot). I designed the entire safe in 3D in order to then design the components that would nest onto the safe itself, the dial, and the handle.

The other 3D piece is a build a Marble Machine that I did for fun, and to try to get my kids interested in basic physics. Every step was conceived and designed by me. Consideration for each element was taken not just for 3D design and aesthetic, but also for structural integrity and printability. The Marble Machine is pretty much the physical manifestation of what goes on in my head all the time. Explains a lot.

The design:
