#Police Call Log Cleaner

The police call log cleaner is a small Ruby program that takes data from `calls.json` in the `json` directory and prints out the street addresses for the types of crime that we actually care about.  

The `calls.json` file was generated using code in the [Boulder Crime](https://github.com/baghaii/BoulderCrime) repository.
