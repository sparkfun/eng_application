Code Sample
============

Instructions
-------------

In this folder, please include a representative code sample.

Code samples from one of your personal projects is preferred, though the following features are what we are looking for:

* Clean, consistently formatted code.
* Documented well enough for a stranger to use/understand your code. 
* Licensed and attributed properly (as applicable). 

Additional points
------------------

* Samples will be read, not executed.  
* Less is more
* This must be your original work. Any partial contributions from others should be attributed.
