The Singing Nutcrackers
-----------------------

Included in this folder is the Arduino code I used for my Singing Nutcracker project. The project uses four Christmas Nutcrackers, the [Teensy 3.6](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14057), the [Teensy Audio Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12767), and the brilliant [Teensy Audio System Design Tool](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/). It allows independant control of four separate solenoid circuits to control each of the Nutcracker's mouths individually, based on audio output from each channel.
