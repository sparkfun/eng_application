Compiling and Running
=====================

This is a game that is made in Java. This game is intended to be run using Java 7. After compiling this game, run `java MasterBlaster` to begin playing.

Known Issues
============

This game is known to have issues running at proper speed in Windows. It has been tested to run properly on both Linux and Mac computers. It appears that the method of timing used for the task scheduler seems to slow down the game, possibly due to some system call.

There are also sometimes issues while playing the audio, as a sound effect has been observed to fail sometimes.

Licensing
=========
This is game is written by Vadim Nikiforov. It is licenced under GPLv2.0.
Contact Vadim for a modified version with fewer special effects that runs well on a Raspberry Pi if interested.


Other Sotware Used
==================

In order to make the artwork for this game, I used GIMP.

In order to make the audio for this game, I used the tracker inspired program, Sunvox.
