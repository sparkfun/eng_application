XBee_ELSequencerV3.ino
Modified by Ho Yun Bobby Chan @ SparkFun Electronics May 12th, 2017

 * Taken from the SparkFun XBee EL Sequencer Demo Sketch
 * Ho Yun Bobby Chan @ SparkFun Electronics June 20, 2014
 * Updated by Toni Klopfenstein @ SparkFun Electronics April, 2015
 * https://github.com/sparkfun/EL_Sequencer
 *
 * Description:
 * This is a modified sketch for the EL Sequencer with a wireless controller.
 * The wireless controller consists of a RedBoard Programmed with Arduino,
 * XBee Explorer, XBee Series 1 transceiver, diffused RGB Common Cathode LED,
 * Blue Clear LED, 330Ohm current limiting resistors, 3x buttons, 
 * a 9V battery, and a 9V adapter.
 *
 * Each of the 7x EL dance suits use an EL Sequencer, 2x EL Wires, a
 * 12V EL inverter, XBee female sockets soldered, a 9V battery, 9V adapter,
 * and a XBee Series 1 transceiver.  Each EL Sequencer will use this same code.
 * An XBee Series 2 can be used but the throughput of the Series 1 is 
 * much higher. To reduce latency, I recommend using the XBee
 * Series 1. The basic configuration of the XBee module with point-to-point configuratin is
 * based on Digi's Example tutorial => https://www.digi.com/blog/xbee/basic-xbee-802-15-4-chat/.
 * Page 5 of the tutorial shows you how to broadcast with
 * point-to-multipoint configuration so that multiple EL Sequencers
 * can be controlled.
 *
 * By pushing the button, a character is sent from a remote microcontroller.
 * The corresponding EL Sequencer will receive the character and control
 * the EL component on a channel that is associated with that character.
 *
 * EL Sequencer uses the hardware UART of the Atmega328 for communication:
 * pin 0 = Rx
 * pin 1 = Tx
 *
 * Note: Make sure to remove the XBee Series 1 on the EL Sequencer when
 * uploading a new sketch file. Otherwise it will brick the XBee. You can
 * always use the next generation XCTU software to unbrick and recover
 * the transceiver.
 *
 * Development environment specifics:
 * Arduino 1.6.5
 *
 * This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the local,
 * and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
 * Distributed as-is; no warranty is given.
