###**How to Put Your Socks on**
We've all been there; you're getting ready in the morning and everything's going great - you've eaten a solid breakfast, you've got your favorite outfit on - and then, just before you head out the door, it hits you.  "I have no idea how to put my socks on," you think to yourself, "I'm never going to get out of here!"  Fear not, my friend.  This handy tutorial will show you everything you need to know about socks so you can get out there and start your day right!

####**Step One: Choosing Socks**
This is perhaps the most daunting part of the process - picking out which socks to wear.  There are so many factors to consider!  Calf-high, or no-show?  Wool, or cotton?  Grey, or purple?  We can narrow down some of the possibilities by answering a few simple questions.

First, think about the weather.  Is it going to be freezing cold?  Then maybe a thicker, longer sock will suit you.  If the sun is going to beating down on you all day, then perhaps a sweat-wicking sock is more appropriate.  

You also want to consider your outfit.  Socks can either be the most understated part of your dress or they can add a pop of character.  If you're feeling bold, go ahead and rock those hot-pink dress socks under your suit.  If you want to tone it down, just go for plain grey or black.

In the end, the sock you choose is totally up to you.  And if you've made it this far, congratulations!  We're almost to the end of this crazy adventure we call putting on socks.

###**Step Two:  Left Foot**
Now that we've got our socks chosen, we're ready to put them on.  Start by sitting down on a sturdy, solid surface, such as a chair or couch.  Bring your left leg up and over your right leg so that it is resting, as if you were getting comfortable in your seat.  Take one of the socks with both hands and, ensuring that the heel of the sock is facing down, insert your thumbs into the tube while your remaining digits grip the outside of the sock.  Alternating hands, use your remaining digits to pull at the remaining length of sock until the tube is completely around your thumbs.  Keeping hold of the sock, use your thumbs to stretch apart the opening of the tube wide enough to put your toes through.  Stick your toes in while simultaneously pulling the sock towards you, keeping a tight grip on the excess sock.  Once you feel that your toes are securely in place, being pulling back the excess sock material so that it fits snugly around your foot.  Once the sock is fully on your foot, check for any bunched-up material or creases and smooth them out.  If you feel any unwanted tension, try moving the material around in that spot and see if it's relieved.  Once your foot is comfortably inside, we can move on to the right foot.

###**Step Three: Right Foot**
Surprisingly, putting a sock on your right foot is exactly the same as your left foot!  Now that you've had some practice putting a sock on your left foot, go ahead and see if you can put a sock on your right foot without looking at the tutorial.
