## Requirements

 * A glass of some kind, I like a mason jar because I drink a lot of water.
 * Ice, if your water is not already cold.
 * Water, I use tap water, but any water that is safe to drink will work.
 * A liquid water flavor, I'm using MiO Fruit Punch.

## How To

 1. Put some ice in your cup. I use 5-6 chunks for my mason jar.


 2. Fill your cup until the ice is floating. By partially filling before adding the flavor, it mixes better.

 3. Add the water flavoring. The exact amount is something you'll have to play with. I like to squeeze just hard enough for the juice to flow and hold that for about a two count.

 4. Fill your cup to whatever level you want, since I like to drink a lot of water, I go right to the top

 5. Finally, I like my water to be very cold, so I finish by adding a little more ice.
