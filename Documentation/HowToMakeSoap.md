#How to Make Bar Soap - The Basics
Ever wonder how to make that stuff that keeps you from smelling too bad?
You can make it easily with this guide and a few easily accesible materials
you probably have lyeing (HAH!) around the house already!  Remember that scene
from Fightclub with the lye?  Yeah, don't do that.  Always wear safety gear when
working with caustic materials.

##Materials
Sparkfun Safety Shirt, Safety Glasses, Rubber Gloves    
Stainless Steel Pot, 3 gallons or larger  
Wooden Spoon  
Electronic Stick Blender  
Stainless Steel Thermometer  
An Electronic Scale or Balance to Measure the Following  
1600.5g Distilled water  
597.0g Lye  
1785.9g Olive Oil  
1190.7g Coconut Oil  
1362.0g Palm Oil  
Plastic Molds or Plastic Tupperware for Forming Soap  

##Step 1: Mix
(Carefully, with safety equipment on) mix Lye and water.  They will react and heat rapidly to over 100°C.
While Lye/Water mixture are cooling (it takes about 2.5 hours), heat all oils in stainless steel pot to 100°C.
Once both mixtures are at 100°C, mix lye into oil while stirring (you may want a buddy to help you).

##Step 2: Mix Some More
Now here's the important part.  Use the stick blender in a stirring motion at max setting to physically mix
the fat and lye mixture.  You'll notice the soap will begin to get thicker and more difficult to mix as time
goes on.  Mix with stick blender for 45 seconds at 27% duty cycle (45s on, 120s off) for about 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes, when you pull out the blender you should notice "tracing", which is a more solid strip of soap
that remains on the top of the mixture for at least three seconds before disappearing back into the mixture.
The soap is ready to mold.

##Step 3: Pour
Pour the soap mixture into whatever you chose to use as a mold.  You should notice it has become thick while
still retaining a consistent laminar flow.  If you notice "chunks" this could be a sign of overmixing (okay)
but much worse unreacted oil (which implies unreacted lye).  You done goofed during step 2, and this soap is unsafe
to use.  (Remember the Fightclub comment?  Not worth the risk..)  

##Step 4: Swaddle
Assuming everything went well (yay!) wrap your poured molds in a few towels or old blankets.  Put in your oven
with the light on.  Leave overnight to finish curing.  In the morning, you should notice the soap is fairly hard
but still soft enough to cut.  Cut to desired bar size (it's easier now rather than later) and put on plastic hobby
mesh to continue curing (I prefer dehydrator trays).  It will take another 3-5 weeks to fully cure, after which you
can take a potato peeler to the corners to soften the edges so you don't cut yourself with soap in the shower, you 
big baby.
