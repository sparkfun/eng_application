# How to make [hot] Milo

If you haven't heard of Milo, it's okay! It's an Australian chocolate malt drink that is not only popular down under, but also in a few other countries. You could drink Milo hot or cold. If your grocery store carries it, there are also canned Milo drink (cold) designed to pack in your lunch. Milo could be made 'plain' or sweetened some more with condensed milk or sugar. Richness could be added to Milo with some milk. The hardest thing about Milo for some people is learning how to prepare this powdered chocolate drink to ensure that it is not too watery.

  - Teaspoon
  - Mug
  - Kettle
  - Condensed milk for extra richness and sweetness (optional)
  - and/or regular milk, for extra richness (not pictured, optional)
  - Powdered Milo mix

### Step 1: Boil the water in the kettle 
  1. For hot Milo, a kettle is needed to ensure solubility of the chocolate crystals.
  2. Take your kettle and fill it with water if needed.
  3. Once water is in the kettle, turn on the fire and wait until water turns to a boil.

1. While the kettle is boiling, scoop out 2-3 (4 max) teaspoons full of Milo powder (for a 4~8 inch mug).

2. Don't be like me. Try not to eat off all of the dry Milo. Though, it's okay if you do.

### Optional Step 3: Making Milo with Condensed Milk

1. Using the teaspoon, scoop out 2 teaspoons of condensed milk, or until the bottom surface of the mug has been half-covered by condensed milk.

### Optional Step 4: Making Milo with Other Milk
1. You could add richness to Milo by adding equal parts milk to the amount Milo powder already in the mug. Not pictured.

### Step 5: Pouring Boiled Water

1. Once the kettle has been boiled, pour the hot water into your mug. It doesn't matter where you stop, though the chocolate is likely to dissolve when you pour the hot water close to the maximum height of the mug.

2. Once poured, you will notice that the Milo has a frothy white top. The frothiness means that there is enough Milo in the mug.
3. The Milo mix in your mug may bubble a little bit if you have added cold milk milk or cold condensed milk. This is okay.

4. If there are a few chunks of chocolate left over, that's okay, but it does mean that there was a little bit too much milo in the mug. If your mug was not filled to the top, you could solve this by poring in more hot water.
5. Stir Milo.
