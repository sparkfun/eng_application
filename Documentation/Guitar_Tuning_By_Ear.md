Guitar Tuning By Ear
================
**Assumptions**
 > This is a basic guide for getting started with tuning your guitar by ear. It assumes that you have experience tuning a guitar with an electronic tuner, and that you know the basics of guitar playing.

The Gist
-----------

 1. Find a source you trust, or, if there is none, tune relative to your low E-string
 2. Always tune *up* to the target pitch
 3. Try plucking in different ways
 4. Listen for the **audio beats** to slow down as your string becomes in-tune
 5. Check intonation by playing some open chords, like E

Steps
-------
### 1. Pick your tone source
There's an unlimited number of options here. Use a piano, a keyboard, another guitar, or search online for "online guitar tuner".

If you have no other source to tune to, you can always tune relative to your low E-string. If it has been a long time, go ahead and tune the low E-string up a touch to approximately make up for the strings stretching out.
You can use the 5th-fret on the lower string to produce the next string's note (4th-fret in case of the G and B-strings). You can also use the harmonic over the 5th fret on the lower string to produce the harmonic over the 7th fret on the higher string (again, except for the G and B-strings). Also consider simply playing a string open with its neighbor and listening for the chord to become in-tune.

### 2. De-tune your string slightly
It is easier to tune *up* to your target note than it is to tune down. So, the first thing you should do is tune down a little bit.

This is more a matter of mechanics than anything else. Tuning up keeps a smooth amount of tension on the tuning mechanism which allows you to have finer control. This also will keep your string in tune longer since it shores up the slop in-between the gears which might otherwise give-way after a short amount of playing.

### 3. Pluck in different ways

While tuning, consider trying to pluck in a few different ways to emphasize different timbres. Use a pick, your finger, or your finger-nail to achieve different attacks. Also try playing nearer to, or farther away from the bridge.

### 4. Tune up, listening for the audio beats to slow down

The clearest sign that you are close to being in tune, but you are not yet, is listening for the [audio beats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_%28acoustics%29). This is a wave phenomenon where two nearly-identical waves produce a 3rd tone by periodically cancelling each other out. It can sound like a "wah-wah", almost a click noise, or another note.

Your goal while tuning is to get the audio beat to drop in frequency (make the "wah-wah" slow down, the clicks spread out, or the note drop in pitch. Mathematically speaking, perfect intonation means the beat has an infinitely long period. Nice.

### 5. Play a couple of chords

Once you've gone through each string, make sure that the strings sound good together. Play a few open chords, like an E-major chord. Sometimes you'll notice a sour note. Often, you'll be reminded of how beautiful an in-tune guitar sounds.


Motivation
--------------
 >*Why bother tuning by ear when I have a perfect electronic tuner?*

Good question. 
There's two reasons: it is practical, and it makes you a better musician.

Practicality is obvious - maybe you run out of batteries or forget your tuner. Tune by ear. Done.

Greater musicianship may be less obvious, and it is far more important. Tuning by ear means training your ear. When you first start out, you can't hear how out of tune your guitar is, in the same way I can't taste "hints of coriander and black pepper" that a sommelier insists is there.

Over time, you will acquire the taste of intonation. You'll begin to hear if your guitar is out of tune by simply playing one chord. Then you'll be able to hear whether you are in tune with other instruments. If you like to sing, you'll better notice when your voice isn't quite hitting the right notes, and you'll be able to better appreciate when it is. When you bend a string, you'll bend to an actual note, rather than to a vague upward direction.

I said the practicality is obvious. Then again, maybe there is more to it. When you go to play a duet with a pianist, do you expect the piano to be in agreement with your electronic tuner? Just like guitar strings, piano strings drop in pitch over time. If you want to play perfectly in tune, you'll have to use your ear.

These benefits are gradual, subtle, and take time. That's ok, because the cost is maybe 2 minutes each time you tune your guitar. Soon enough, you'll be able to tune your guitar just as fast by ear.
