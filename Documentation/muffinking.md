###How to:
Be a Muffin King (or Queen)
================

Although a seeming simple task, preparing a hot buttered muffin of the highest quality in the short amount of time typically available during your morning routine is critical.

The proper combination of muffin, butter, and heat  are *essential* to you or your muffin recipient's quality of morning, so it's a good idea to get it right.  Your lunchtime you will thank us both for the effort put forth. Let's begin with assembling the necessary materials.

##Materials
* The muffin of choice.

   As fresh as possible, no more than 1 week old. Fruit optional.
* Butter.

  Generally there are two options here:
  * Salted
  * Unsalted

  However, if you have already run through this tutorial successfully a few times there is a third, advanced option:
  * Unsalted, with salt added.

* Butter knife.

* A microwave oven.

##Procedure

1. Collect your muffin, butter, and knife in the vicinity of your microwave oven to minimize crumb losses from carrying the muffin back and forth. The French could generously call this *mise en place*.

2. Using your butter knife, cut a small X into the middle of the top of your muffin.  Each leg of the X should be about the width of the knife, and extend no more than halfway to the bottom of the muffin.

3. Using the knife again, cut two 5mm slices of butter off of the end of your stick of butter.

4. Apply the butter to the muffin in one of two ways:
  * Break each slice in two, and insert each half-slice into a leg of your X.
  * Insert one slice into your X whole, and break the other slice in half.  Insert these halves into the remaining vacant legs of the X.

5. If you are going with the advanced butter option, this is the time to add a pinch of your highest quality salt to the top of the X, over the butter.

6. Place your newly buttered muffin into the microwave and set the timer to 15 seconds. (This is the optimal cooking time for a 1000W microwave oven, you may need to adjust your time if your oven wattage differs.)

7. When cooking is complete, allow the muffin to rest for approximately 1 minute.  This gives the butter time to melt fully, and allows the temperature to reach equilibrium within the muffin body, providing you with a perfectly evenly heated muffin with the right amount of butter in every bite.
