Today we learn how to make the most humble of sandwiches, the peanut butter and jelly!

 

First you'll need to gather your ingredients:

- Two slices of your favorite bread
- One jar of your favorite peanut butter 
- One jar of your favorite jelly
- A knife for the spreading
- A plate to contain your finished sandwichy goodness

Let's Begin!
-------------
Lay both slices of bread on the plate, side by side. Let's designate the left slice as the peanut butter slice and the right slice as the jelly slice. 

Open the peanut butter jar by turning the lid counter clockwise and dip the knife in, scooping out as much peanut butter as you'd enjoy consuming. 

Spread the peanut butter on the peanut butter slice (remember, this is the slice of bread on the left), making sure to make an even coat about 5mm thick. 

Close the peanut butter jar by replacing the lid on top of the jar and turning it clockwise.

Wipe any extraneous peanut butter from the knife onto the jelly slice.

Open the jelly jar (again, turn the lid counter clockwise) and dip the knife in, scooping out as much jelly as you'd enjoy consuming.

Spread the jelly on the jelly slice, making sure to get an nice even coat. 

Close the jelly jar by replacing the lid on top of the jar and turning it clockwise.
