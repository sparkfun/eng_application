How to Science
=============

Introduction
-----------------
<p>
Science is awesome.  It’s an iterative process that brings us closer to truth, and without it we wouldn’t have the myriad magical technologies we routinely take for granted today!  When I learned about the scientific process in middle school, I thought it was some abstract concept that would never have any bearing on my life unless I ended up with a career in a laboratory.  Some time between when the state considered me to be an adult, and when I felt as though I was one, I came to realize the value of science in a variety of settings and use it daily to make my life better.

<p>
When debugging code, fixing appliances around the house, or cooking dinner, I use the scientific method to solve problems or improve my design.  Read on, and I will explain how the scientific process works, and how it can be applied your living room, and not just a laboratory.

Observe
-----------
<p>
Really before this step there is some impetus, a problem to be solved such as “why am I getting this run-time error?” or “how can I make this sauce thicker?”  The first step towards finding a solution is to make observations and gather data.  In the case of debugging this might mean stepping through code and watching variables to see how they change, printing messages to the console, or reading log files.  If the goal is honing a process, this might mean detailed measurements to determine what steps might have the greatest potential for improvement.

Hypothesize
----------------
<p>
A hypothesis is what we non-scientists think of as a theory.  In science, theory has a different meaning, and signifies a hypothesis that has been tested quite a bit and is most likely true.  A hypothesis doesn’t have to be right.  Sometimes it’s helpful to just to rule some things out.  This is why the first thing you’ll hear when talking to tech support is, “have you tried turning it off and back on again?”
</p>
<p>
I tend to spend a lot of time collecting data until I have an “ah ha!” moment and a hypothesis pops into my head.  If you’re having trouble developing a hypothesis, try something simple just to keep things moving, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to create a hypothesis if your first guess isn’t correct.
</p>

Predict
---------
<p>
Predictions help to guide tests.  Predictions might be something like, “If my hypothesis is true, entering this value will yield this result.”  Often times when troubleshooting, predictions and tests happen at the same time and could potentially yield solutions, however it is good practice to devise a variety of predictions, focusing on boundary conditions, and on distinct partitions to verify the strength of your hypothesis (or in other words, the effectiveness of your solution).
</p>

Test
-----
<p>
Once predictions are made, tests are conducted.  Scientists aggressively try to disprove their hypotheses, and the strength of a hypothesis or theory is revealed by its ability to make accurate predictions.  Conversely, if the predicted outcome does not occur, then the hypothesis must be discarded or modified, which leads us to...
</p>

Analyze
----------
<p>
After tests are conducted, the results must be analyzed, and applied appropriately.  This may mean developing more tests if a hypothesis is supported by the outcomes, or modifying the hypothesis or discarding altogether if it is not supported.
</p>

Iterate
---------
<p>
The scientific process is an iterative one.  It loops back on itself.  This may mean going back and devising more predictions and tests if a hypothesis is supported.  If a hypothesis fails to predict the outcome of a test, it may mean going back the start, collecting more data, and developing a new hypothesis.  Scientists tend to pursue more iterations than would someone simply trying to solve a problem.  The iterations of this process help to refine hypotheses and push them towards ever greater accuracy.  If solving a problem, it is generally enough to stop after many fewer iterations, needing only to correct the problem at hand.
