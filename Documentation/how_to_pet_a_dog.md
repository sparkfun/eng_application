**Step by step instructions to pet a dog.**

**Assumptions:**
- You are a fully functional human capable of sitting, standing, moving, and speaking.

- You are in a room.
- The dog is in the same room as you.



**1.** Sit down on the ground.

**2.** Speak the name of your dog at a volume of 60-95dB.

**3.** Repeat step 2 until your dog is less than 6 inches in front of you. (Refer to dog.png for example of what a dog looks like.)

    Note: (If at any point step 3 is no longer true, go back to step 2)
	
**4.** If step 3 is true, lift your arm and move your hand in the direction of your dog at 1 mph until your hand contacts your dogs fur.

    Note: (If the dog moves after contact, go back to step 3)

**5.** Assuming the dog is in the same position as upon completion of step 4, place your palm on the closest point with the highest vertical position and a horizontal tangent.

**6.** Press your palm on the surface of the dog at the position from step 5 with 1lb of force.

**7.** Maintain 1lb of force and then move your hand 6 inches horizontally over 1.5 seconds.

**8.** Return your hand to the same position as step 6 over a time frame of 1.5 seconds.

**9.** Repeat steps 6, 7, and 8 until personal satisfaction is achieved.
