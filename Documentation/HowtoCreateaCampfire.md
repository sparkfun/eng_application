#How To Create a Campfire
  The ability to create fire can mean the difference between life and death. For most of us, it is a pleasant activity that can be used to shared with friends and family during a weekend camping adventure. After collecting the materials listed below follow the two part process to create safe fire for yourself and your loved ones.

##Materials

- Wood (Varied sizes from pencil thick to 6" diameter logs
- Tinder (Fine flammable material, can be anything from pine needles to paper towels)
- Fire starter (Flint and Steel, Match, Lighter, Bow Drill)
- Fire friendly location 
- 20 to 30 Softball sized rocks
- Bucket of water

##Part 1: Selecting a Location

1. Locate a spot that is not surrounded by dry materials and does not have anything above where the fire will be such as a low hanging branch. (When deciding if you should make a fire ensure there is no current fire ban in your area, .If you have a premade fire pit or wood burning stove skip to part two.)
2. Next, dig a shallow hole in the ground. This should be about 6 inches deep and about 2 feet in diameter) 
3. Place the 10 largest rocks around the circumference of the hole such that they will be sturdy and support each other from moving.
4. Fill dirt around these rocks to hold them in place then place the rest of the rocks so that they create a good barrior between the fire and the delicate world around it.

##Part 2: Creating Fire

1. Make a small dense pile of the tinder you collected. This should just be waiting to catch fire at the slightest spark. 
2. Next, create a structure around this pile. There are several ways to do this but one way is to create a “Teepee” structure by leaning several pencil sized pieces of wood against eachother.An opening must be built into the structure that you can spark the fine material inside and allow for airflow.
(Before this structure is set ablaze make sure that a bucket of water is nearby. This is essential because no matter how well the fire pit was built or how well experienced you are you can never be too careful. No one wants to be the cause of a forest fire so keep this nearby.)
3. Now comes the fun part, lighting the fire. For simplicity, let’s assume we have a pocket lighter since this is one of the best tools you can bring with you if you are ever out combating the wilderness. Carefully light the tinder inside the teepee.
4. Once this spark has been created it is your responsibility to help it grow. Combustion reactions require oxygen to to occur. Carefully blow into the door of the teepee to provide your baby flame with the fuel it needs to grow. The heat given off by the small flame will rise and heat up the material at the top of the teepee which will ignite at about 150 degrees celcius for decayed wood. 
5. As the tiny spark grows into larger flames, bigger and bigger sticks and logs can be placed on the fire the length of which which are limited to the size of the fire pit created. 
(Make sure you have an ample supply of wood so that the fire can stay lit for the entire time it is needed)
6. Whip out the marshmallows it’s now time to enjoy the masterpiece you have now created. Once the fun is over make sure to smother the fire with the bucket of water
