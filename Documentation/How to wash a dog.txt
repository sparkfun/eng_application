##Step one: Gather the stuff you will need.

* Two towels
* Regular dog shampoo
* Eye safe shampoo

I recommend two towels. One to keep the floor dry and the other for drying the dog after it&#39;s bath. Regular dog shampoo from a pet store is recommended for a bulk of your cleaning. I like to use no tears baby shampoo for washing my dogs head. This is to prevent any discomfort if any shampoo gets into your dogs eyes.

##Step two: Find your dog.

Dogs are smart and sometimes know what you&#39;re up too when you&#39;re planning to wash them. If they get the feeling a bath is coming, they sometimes hide. Find your dog and close any doors to other rooms in the house so they can&#39;t go too far away.

##Step three: Cover the floor.

Lay one of your towels on the floor in front of the bathtub. This towel is here to catch any water that splashes out of the tub during washing, and catches any water dripping off the dog after she has gotten out of the tub.

##Step four: Get your dog into the tub.

If the dog will not go willingly, gently pick it up and place the dog into the bathtub. Talk softly and offer a treat to your dog to keep it calm. Now would be a good time to close the bathroom door to discourage an escape attempt.

##Step five: Get the dog thoroughly wet:

Go ahead and spray the entire dog to get it wet. Shampoo won&#39;t work on a dry dog! This is also a great time to spray off any lose dirt or mud that might be stuck in the dogs fur and paws.

##Step six: Apply regular shampoo:

Squirt a liberal amount of regular dog shampoo onto your dogs back. I like a stripe that goes from the tail of the dog up to the area above dogs front legs. Don&#39;t worry too much about how much shampoo you use here since extra will just rinse away later. After a few washes, you will get a feeling for how much shampoo is enough. If you don&#39;t apply enough shampoo, you can always add more later!

##Step seven: Scrub!

Scrub the shampoo into a thick lather with your brush. If you don&#39;t have a brush, go ahead and use your fingers. Since we can&#39;t easily apply shampoo to the underside of the dog, grab some lather use that on the dogs underside and legs. Don&#39;t forget to apply some lather to the dogs tail but be very careful when scrubbing. The tail is very sensitive and you can hurt your dog if you&#39;re too aggressive.

##Step eight: First rinse

Using your sprayer, rinse all the shampoo off the dog starting from the area above the dogs front legs. Don&#39;t forget to rinse the legs, tail and underside of the dog.

##Step nine: Wash head and neck.

Carefully re-wet your dogs head and neck since it&#39;s probably dried a bit while you were washing the rest of your dog. Apply a small amount of eye safe shampoo to the top of your dogs head and a larger amount on the dogs neck. As before, lather the eye safe shampoo on the head and neck being careful to avoid the dogs eyes.

##Step ten: Second rinse.

Starting at the top of your dogs head, rinse all the shampoo from the head and neck. Be careful to not spray water directly into you dogs eyes as this will at the least be uncomfortable and at most, may be painful to your dog. She&#39;s already been through a lot, and you don&#39;t want to make bath time anymore stressful than it already has been. A little bit of water trickling into the eyes is OK at this point but keep it to a minimum. Go ahead and give the rest of the dog a quick rinse since a little bit of the eye safe shampoo might have gotten on the dogs back.

##Step eleven: Drying.

Have the dog get out of the tub and onto the towel you put down on the floor earlier. Quickly grab your other towel and toss it on top of the dog. If you&#39;re not fast enough on this step, your dog will begin shaking excess water off her body and you will get a shower! Rub the towed over the dogs entire body to get as much water off her fur as possible. You&#39;re done when the dog is damp but not dripping anymore.

##Step twelve: A reward and the final dry!

Now that your dog is almost dry, give her a nice treat for being so good in the tub. Leash your dog and take her for a nice long walk outside. On a warm, sunny day your dog will dry in about fifteen minutes. A trip to the park is another great thing to treat your dog to after a bath.
