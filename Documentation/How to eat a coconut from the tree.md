# How to open and eat coconuts from the tree

[!the finished product](/img/cocospoon)

While I was at [Junga del Jaguar](http://www.jungladeljaguar.com/), a daily task was husking and opening coconuts.  It takes some elbow grease, but is rewarding.

Supplies needed:
*   husking tool
*   rock or something with hard edge
*   knife or spoon
*   (optional) [coconut shredder](http://www.desiclik.com/coconut-scrapper-w-vacuum-base-pr-18648.html)

Steps:
*   select a good nut
*   husk the nut
*   crack the nut
*   extract the meat

## Finding a good nut
Find a relatively fresh coconut.  Look for one with a nice brown color, not too light and sunbleached, and not too wet or sprouting.  Make sure it's not too heavy, as they soak up water and can have bad bacteria or fungus growing.
