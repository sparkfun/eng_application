# How to open and eat coconuts from the tree

[!the finished product](/img/cocoSpoon)

While I was at [Junga del Jaguar](http://www.jungladeljaguar.com/), a daily task was husking and opening coconuts.  It takes some elbow grease, but is rewarding.

Supplies needed:
*   husking tool
*   rock or something with hard edge
*   knife or spoon
*   (optional) [coconut shredder](http://www.desiclik.com/coconut-scrapper-w-vacuum-base-pr-18648.html)

Steps:
*   select a good nut
*   husk the nut
*   crack the nut
*   extract the meat

## Finding a good nut
Find a relatively fresh coconut.  Look for one with a nice brown color, not too light and sunbleached, and not too wet or sprouting.  Make sure it's not too heavy, as they soak up water and can have bad bacteria or fungus growing.

The middle nut here meets the goldilocks critereon, not too heavy, not too old.

## Husk it real good
To husk the coconut, we'll need a sharp-ish object stuck in the ground--a sharpened piece of wood works well.  We're going to jam the nut on there and use it to pry off the husk.
