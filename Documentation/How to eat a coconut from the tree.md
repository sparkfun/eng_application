# How to open and eat coconuts from the tree

[!the finished product](/img/cocoSpoon)

While I was at [Junga del Jaguar](http://www.jungladeljaguar.com/), a daily task was husking and opening coconuts.  It takes some elbow grease, but is rewarding.

Supplies needed:
*   husking tool
*   rock or something with hard edge
*   knife or spoon
*   (optional) [coconut shredder](http://www.desiclik.com/coconut-scrapper-w-vacuum-base-pr-18648.html)

Steps:
*   select a good nut
*   husk the nut
*   crack the nut
*   extract the meat

## Finding a good nut
Find a relatively fresh coconut.  Look for one with a nice brown color, not too light and sunbleached, and not too wet or sprouting.  Make sure it's not too heavy, as they soak up water and can have bad bacteria or fungus growing.

The middle nut here meets the goldilocks critereon, not too heavy, not too old.

## Husk it real good
To husk the coconut, we'll need a sharp-ish object stuck in the ground--a sharpened piece of wood works well.  We're going to jam the nut on there and use it to pry off the husk.

Slam the nut on the husking tool in order to pierce the husk, aiming for a flat face of the husk.

Push hard and pry the husk off, with a satisfying sound like a combination of ripping off velcro and splitting wood.  Rip the piece of husk off with your hand.  Push the nut/husk boundary onto the husking tool, and continue removing the husk until it is completely gone.

Coconuts are people too! See, they have faces.

## Crack the nut
Once the nut is fully out of the husk, find something hard with an edge, like some concrete or a rock.  Hit the nut hard against the edge a few times to crack the nut in half.  Have a container handy if you want to save the juice inside, and it can sometimes come flying out.

## Extracting the meat

Get a sharp knife and cut a v-shape into the edge of the meat, then push sideways with the knife on one of the cuts.

This will get meat out of the top edge.  The shell can be broken further by hitting it on or with a hard object, and meat further extracted in the same fasion.  A spoon can also be used to extract the meat.

A really nice tool for making shredded coconut is a [coconut shredder](http://www.desiclik.com/coconut-scrapper-w-vacuum-base-pr-18648.html) (weird name, right?).  Place the coconut half on the shredder, and put a plate or bowl underneath to catch the shreds.  Turn the handle of the shredder and be amazed.  The process can be sped up a bit by simultaneously turning the coconut.

There you have it!  Now go eat some coconuts.

I've also written some other tutorials, though maybe not exactly meeting the requirement of this assignment.  They can be found [here](http://wordsforthewise.github.io/gettingStartedWithNodeMCUWindows/) and [here](http://wordsforthewise.github.io/DIY-air-quality-device/).
