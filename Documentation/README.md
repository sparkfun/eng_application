# Introduction

Welcome to Bobby's guide for oral care! Food and bacteria can build up over time and wear down the enamel protecting our precious teeth. Below is an image indicating the enamel covering our teeth.

In this tutorial, you will learn about the basics of brushing your teeth to prevent tooth decay.

# Required Tools & Materials

Before we get started, here are the minimum materials you would need to get started in protecting your teeth's enamel:

* [Manual Toothbrush (Soft Bristle)](https://oralb.com/en-us/products/pro-health-all-in-one-toothbrush)
* [Toothpaste](http://www.colgatetotal.com/toothpaste/clean-mint)
* 8oz Cup 
* Water
* Mirror (optional)

These products can be found at many grocery stores and online retailers. Using a soft toothbrush is sufficient in removing food and bacteria attached to the surface of a tooth. Toothpaste will be used to help clean and strengthen teeth. I personally use an 8oz cup but any size will do. A mirror is not necessary when brushing your teeth. However, it can help in brushing your teeth and checking for areas that may require more cleaning.

# How to Brush Your Teeth

We will assume that your right hand is the dominant hand and your left is the assistant hand. Below are the steps to prepare your toothbrush and brush your teeth in the bathroom.

### Preparing Your Tools
Let us start by getting your tools set up.

1. Fill a cup of warm water from the sink.
2. Grab your favorite brand of toothpaste with your left hand.
3. Using your right hand, open the lid containing the toothpaste.
4. After opening the lid, grab your toothbrush using your right hand with the bristles facing up.
5. Using your left hand's index finger and thumb, gently squeeze a pea sized amount on the bristles.
6. Place the toothpaste aside on a table. 

The image below shows some toothpaste being applied to the toothbrush.

### Brushing Your Teeth

So how do we brush our teeth? It is recommended to have your toothbrush at a 45° angle toward your gum line and teeth. Typical brushing motions can include sweeping the bristles in a linear motion and/or rolling the brush in a circular motion. Make sure to brush your teeth in the morning and at the end of the day. With your toothbrush prepared, you can start brushing your teeth.

1. With the toothbrush still in your dominant hand, place the bristles on your teeth as shown in the image below.

2. Brush you teeth gently using one of the brushing motions as explained above until top row's outer surface has been cleaned.
3. Move the brush toward your tongue with the bristles facing the chewing surface and continue brushing the top row. The image below provides an example of how to clean a chewing surface.

&nbsp;

4. Move the brush further toward your teeth's inner surface while still aiming the bristles at your gum line and teeth. The image below provides an example of how the bristles should be angled to clean the inner surface.

&nbsp;

5. Continue repeating this process for all surfaces of your teeth so that both the top and bottom rows have been cleaned. This should take a minimum of about 2 minutes.
6. To prevent additional bacterial growth in your mouth, brush your tongue gently with the bristles.
7. Once you have cleaned your teeth, you may rinse out any remaining toothpaste with water. Fill your mouth with some water and swoosh it around to remove any food debris or bacteria that have loosened up.
8. Spit out any remaining toothpaste from your mouth into the sink. 

### Maintaining Your Tools and Cleaning Up

Now that you have successfully cleaned your teeth, you will want to maintain your tools and clean up after yourself.

1. Dump out any excess water in the cup.
2. Wash your toothbrush with some hot water to remove any food debris, bacteria, or paste left on the bristles.
3. Air dry the toothbrush by placing it in your cup. Be sure to have the toothbrush in an upright position with good air flow and avoid having the brush come into contact with a surface.
4. Close the lid to your toothpaste.

Over time, your toothbrush may lose its effectiveness in cleaning your teeth. It is recommended to replace your toothbrush about every 3 months or until the brush has lost its original form. If your toothbrush has bent bristles, it is a good indicator that you need to replace your toothbrush. Make sure to also clean out your cup and prevent any thin films from forming at the bottom.
