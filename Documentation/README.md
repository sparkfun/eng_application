Documentation Instructions
==========================

Disclaimer
-------------
Okay, so I might not have followed the directions here to the letter. It was requested that the documentation be for an everyday task, something simple. I may have strayed from that objective slightly.

See, what happened was...
-------------------------
...after working with an educator for about a week, and eventually bringing in Jeff Branson, on Friday morning the 22nd, I figured out the necessary steps to get the [Picoboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11888) working with a Chromebook, a task that has eluded many. Jeff was elated, and asked me if I would be willing to write a tutorial explaining the process, as he felt that it would help the declining sales of the PicoBoard, which are corresponding with the increase in the use of Chromebooks in schools. I wanted to get it down on (digital) paper while it was still fresh in my mind. If it's too much (I know it's a lot of reading - my apologies), I can resubmit with something shorter, and more within the guidelines of what would be considered everyday activities.
