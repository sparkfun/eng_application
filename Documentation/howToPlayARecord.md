How to play a vinyl record:
===========================

1. Gather Materials. You will need: a record player, stereo, speakers, and a vinyl record of your choice. 
2. Pull the record out of it's sleeve while holding only the edges to avoid damaging the grooves.
3. Place the record on the platter of the record player. 
4. Select the speed. Twelve inch vinyls are usually played at 33 RPM, while seven inch vinyls are usually played at 45 RPM.
5. (Optional but recommended) If you have a felt vinyl cleaning brush, use it now to remove any dust before playback. 
6. If your record player has cueing functionality, you can just press start/play and enjoy. If your record player uses manual cueing, lift the stylus and lightly place it upon the record and press start/play.
7. Sit back and enjoy listening to music in pure analog bliss.
