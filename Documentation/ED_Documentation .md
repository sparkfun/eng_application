##### Items needed:
- Ornaments 
- Ornaments hooks
- Christmas lights 
- Tree topper
- garland (optional)


1. **Top the tree:** Begin with placing the tree topper on the top most part of the trunk. 
2. **Illuminate:**  If your tree topper lights up, plug the topper in to the end of the first strand of christmas lights. If not, wrap the terminal end of the lights (the end that will not plug into the wall) around the top most part of the trunk. Then wrap the lights around the tree, placing them on top of branches, half way between the end of the branch and the trunk, plunging in additional strands when needed, and plug end into wall outlet.
4. **Garland the tree:** If you have chosen to use a garland, start at the top of the three, and wrap it around similar to how the lights were wrapped, but placing the garland close to the edges of the branches. 
5. **Adorn with Ornaments:** Place the ornaments evenly across the branches of the tree. Hook the smaller end of the ornament hook to the loop on the ornament, and the larger side of the hook onto the tree, towards the end of the branch. If you want secure ornament, squeeze the loops closed with your fingers (ideal for pet owners). For best results, place ornaments on branches that donâ€™t droop with the weight of the ornament.
