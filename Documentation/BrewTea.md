#:tea: A TEAching Moment

Have you ever wondered how to make a good pot of tea?  In this document, I will show you how to brew a nice cup of tea.

## Materials
* loose tea (We selected [Upton Tea](http://www.uptontea.com/))
* teapot (We used a 6-cup Chatsford Earhenware Pot)
* tea kettle (We used a Le Creuset.  Use whatever kettle you want.)
* measuring spoons
* water

## Heat the Water
Fill the tea kettle with water.  **NOTE: Do not place your teapot on the stove.  It can shatter if it is exposed to high heat.**  Place the kettle on the stove and turn the stove to high heat.

If you are making a black tea, heat the water until it boils.  If you are making a green tea, take your kettle off the stove when you hear bubbles inside the kettle and before it actually boils because green teas typically brew at a lower temperature.  **NOTE: High temperatures can make your green teas bitter.**

## Steep the Tea

Place one tablespoon of tea in the infuser.  In our case, the infuser is the basket with the red grip inside the teapot.  Place the infuser in your teapot.  Now pour the water into your teapot.  Now wait.  If you are using Upton tea, the container should tell you how long to steep your tea.  Most teas steep for about 3 to 5 minutes.  After your tea has finished steeping, you can remove your infuser from your teapot so that the tea does not get stronger.  

## Enjoy a Cup of Tea
