So you want to fry an egg? It's quite simple, all you'll need is the following:

+ A couple eggs (1–3 recommended)
+ A frying pan
+ A burner
+ Butter or vegetable oil
+ Spatula 
+ Salt and pepper
+ _(Optional)_ a butter knife for cracking the eggs

###<u>Preparation</u>
Begin by placing the frying pan on the burner and igniting the flame.

Now, place your butter or oil in the pan to bring it to cooking temperature.

###<u>The Messy Part</u>
Once your butter is melted or your oil is heated, go ahead and grab your eggs. If you grabbed a butter knife, use the sharp edge and quickly but lightly whack the exterior of the egg to make an incision, but not slice it in half. If you didn't grab a butter knife, simply use any hard, thin object nearby (e.g. edge of pan, edge of spatula, etc.)

Once you have a crack in the shell, hold the egg over the pan and pull the shell apart from the crack to free the yolk and white from inside, and let them drop into the pan.

###<u>Let's Get Cooking</u>
Depending on your appetite, you may be in the mood for a different style of egg, which is all in how you treat the yolk. Use the following table for a reference on how to get the kind of egg you want. (Note: All flipping of the eggs should be done with the spatula from the list above). For the name of the egg style, simply hover your cursor over the image.

| Egg style | Characteristics| How to achieve it |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------- |
|![Sunny-side up](https://christinathepolyglot.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eggs-sunny-side-up-in-pan.jpg?w=535 "Sunny-side up") | Only one side is fried; yolk remains liquid. | Cook on a low setting to prevent burning the bottom, and simply don't flip the egg. It's finished when the white is solid. |

| ![overhard](http://images.meredith.com/bhg/images/recipe/l_R158683.jpg "Eggs over hard")| Both sides are thoroughly cooked; yolk is solid. | Cook on a medium to high setting. A lid can be used to steam the top of the egg, or egg can be flipped once white solidifies. It's finished when the yolk is solid (it can be broken to speed up the process) |

| ![Scrambled](http://low-carb-meal-plans.com/foods/scrambledeggs.jpg "Scrambled") |Fluffy chunks of yolk and white cooked together. This is the "mashed potatoes" of eggs. |Yolks and whites are continuously stirred during cooking to prevent a solid shape from forming. Cheese and milk are typically added for flavor. |
